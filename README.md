# 2DGSx-DSR

2DGSx-DSR is an extended version of [diff-surfel-rasterization](https://github.com/hbb1/diff-surfel-rasterization), 
rasterization engine for the paper "2D Gaussian Splatting for Geometrically Accurate Radiance Fields" with the following improvments:
1. Implementation from [Object-centric 2DGS paper](https://github.com/MarcelRogge/object-centric-2dgs) to have better segmentation of objects and reduced gaussian size.
